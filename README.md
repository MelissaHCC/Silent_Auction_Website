The overall Spring Boot Project is too large to upload as one file.

Create a main folder and place all but the website files in the main folder with the appropiate names.
ie Midterm_SpringBoot_src, will get unzipped into the main folder with the name src.

The files in the Midterm_SpringBoot_pom_and_more will be placed directly in the main folder. 

The Silent_Auction_Website files will need to be placed in a subfolder.
That path will be:
main folder -> src -> main -> resources -> static

They were also found in the following paths
main folder -> target -> classes -> static
main folder -> target -> classes -> templates
